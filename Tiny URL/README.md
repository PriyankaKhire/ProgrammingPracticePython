To start the project:

    open cmd prompt and first start Approch2.py from Server/Approches dir
    
    open another cmd prompt then start Server.py from Server dir
    
    then open IDLE window and start Client.py
    
once you start client, it will ask you to type url

After that to verify the database just go into database folder and unUsedkeys.txt and usedKeys.txt would have been created.

The output of approch2 explains why the unUsedKeys.txt is present there.
