<h1>Message Queues</h1>

  <h2>What is it ?</h2>
  <p>It's a temporary storage system between a sender and receiver. 
  So a sender sends a message and they are done, they can then process the next message to send. 
  On the other hand, the receiver receives the message and then they can take their own time to act on it.
  </p>
  <p>One of the best example of message queue is email.
  The sender sends an email and the receiver at their own convenience opens it up and replies.
  There is no added pressure of immediately responding to it.
