<h1>Network Protocols</h1>
  <p>Network protocols make it possible for any networked computers to talk to each other</p>
  <h2>Networking Models</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>TCP/IP Model</li>
      <li>OSI Model</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Networking Protocols</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Internet Protocol:</b> It is the key protocol that allows computers in different physical networks to communicate with each other</li>
      <li><b>Transport Control Protocol (TCP):</b> It works by first establishing a connection between the client and server, and then transferring data. It builds on IP to add guarantees that data messages are delivered reliably and, in order</li>
      <li><b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</b> It works at the same layer as TCP, but has no guarantees about data delivery or ordering. So if the application needs faster data transfer and doesnâ€™t require a confirmed connection we can use UDP</li>
      <li><b>Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP):</b> It allows applications to view and modify data over the network </li>
